#### Milestone 3: Parsing Stage with One Language Adapter (Rust)

**Scope:** Stand up the parsing pipeline end-to-end with a single language: Rust itself (dogfood). File walker, `LanguageAdapter` trait, `FeatureRecord` struct, parallel parsing via `rayon`. Enforce the CST-drop ownership invariant. The other five adapters land in Milestone 4.

**Deliverables:**
- `LanguageAdapter` trait in `sdi-parsing::adapter` with methods to parse a file and emit a `FeatureRecord`
- `FeatureRecord` struct: path, imports (Vec<String>), exports, function/class/method signatures, pattern instance handles. `serde::Serialize + Deserialize`
- `parse_repository(&Config, &Path) -> impl Iterator<Item = FeatureRecord>` doing breadth-first stable-sorted walk
- `walkdir` + `ignore` + `globset` honoring `.gitignore` and `core.exclude`
- `rayon` parallel parsing; per-worker grammar instance
- `sdi-lang-rust` crate implementing `LanguageAdapter` with `tree-sitter-rust` linked at compile time behind feature `lang-rust`

**Files to create or modify:**
- `crates/sdi-parsing/src/{adapter.rs,feature_record.rs,walker.rs,parse.rs}`
- `crates/sdi-lang-rust/{Cargo.toml,build.rs,src/lib.rs}`
- `tests/fixtures/simple-rust/` with 5–10 known files (cargo crate skeleton, lib.rs with declared modules, mod files)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `parse_repository` on `tests/fixtures/simple-rust/` returns the same `Vec<FeatureRecord>` (after sorting) on every run
- The fixture has known import counts; assertion in test
- Memory invariant: a test that parses a 1MB Rust file and asserts peak heap stays bounded (use a `tracking-allocator` or count `Tree` allocations via a feature-gated counter)
- Parsing on an empty directory returns zero records, no error
- `core.exclude` glob suppresses files; `.gitignore` is honored

**Tests:**
- `crates/sdi-parsing/tests/walk_ordering.rs`: walk twice, assert identical paths
- `crates/sdi-parsing/tests/memory_invariant.rs`: parse 100 large files, assert no `Tree` survives across files (use a feature-gated `Drop` counter on a wrapper type around `tree_sitter::Tree`)
- `tests/full_pipeline.rs` (top-level): parse fixture, assert `FeatureRecord` count matches a hand-counted constant
- Property test in `crates/sdi-parsing/tests/proptest.rs`: random file content → parse never panics

**Watch For:**
- The parsing API must consume `String` (or `Vec<u8>`) by value and the returned `FeatureRecord` must own no reference into the input — otherwise the CST-drop invariant becomes a lifetime puzzle
- `tree-sitter` grammar instances are not `Send` in some grammar versions; verify before using `rayon::par_iter`. Fall back to per-worker `thread_local!` grammars if needed
- Stable-sort the file list **before** parallelizing; otherwise rayon's internal scheduling can leak ordering nondeterminism into downstream stages
- `walkdir` + `ignore` interaction: use the `ignore` crate's `WalkBuilder` rather than composing manually — `.gitignore` semantics are subtle

**Seeds Forward:**
- The `LanguageAdapter` trait is stable from here. Milestone 4 adds five adapters that implement it without changing the trait
- `FeatureRecord` is the input to Milestone 5 (graph) and Milestone 6 (patterns) — its shape must accommodate both. Pattern instance handles must include enough metadata for the patterns stage without reparsing
- The deterministic walk order is a load-bearing assumption for snapshot bit-stability
